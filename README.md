This little project was inspired by the Talking Electronics, TEC-1, Z80 computer. 
It consists of THREE small foot print pcbs.  
Memory is 2K or 8K addressable by jumpers.
56 pin, 0.1" pitch expansion bus brings out all 40 Z80 pins and 16 memory/port decoder pins for easy trouble shooting and proto boarding.
Easy expandability by stacking pcbs.
Manual RESET and SHIFT keys
Waiting on new KEYS to produce better Keypad, which will use a 14 pin IDC connector.
Plan to cobble a Rockwell 6522 VIA based pcb together shortly.
